# Computer Vision Project Template

This repository provides a template structure for computer vision projects, incorporating common stages like data annotation, model training, and inference.

## Components

1.  **Data Annotation (`data_annotation/`)**: Tools and scripts for preparing and annotating image or video datasets. (Example: using a tool like GroundingDINO or LabelImg).
2.  **Object Detection/Tracking (`object_detection_tracking/`)**: Modules for detecting and tracking objects in images or video streams. (Example: using models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN with trackers like ByteTrack or DeepSORT).
3.  **Downstream Task (`downstream_task/`)**: Application-specific module that utilizes the outputs from previous stages. (Example: volume estimation, activity recognition, image segmentation).

## Features

-   Modular structure for different CV tasks.
-   Example scripts for training and inference.
-   Support for dataset management.
-   Conda environment for reproducible setup.
-   Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and visualization.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Create Conda Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate your-env-name
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure necessary model weights or pre-trained models are downloaded as per component-specific READMEs).*

3.  **Download Datasets (Optional):**
    If your project uses specific datasets, provide instructions or a script to download them.
    ```bash
    # Example:
    # python download_script.py
    # or run a Jupyter Notebook:
    # jupyter notebook download_datasets.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

Each component typically resides in its own directory with specific instructions and scripts:

-   **`data_annotation/`**: Follow instructions in `data_annotation/README.md` for dataset preparation. (e.g., run `annotation_tool.py` or `main_annotation_notebook.ipynb`).
-   **`object_detection_tracking/`**:
    -   Train your model: `python train_detector.py --config config_file.yaml` (adjust configuration as needed).
    -   Run inference: Use provided notebooks (e.g., `run_inference_video.ipynb`) or scripts (`run_inference_webcam.py`).
-   **`downstream_task/`**:
    -   Train your task-specific model: `python train_task_model.py` (if applicable).
    -   Run inference/application: Use provided notebooks or scripts (e.g., `run_application.ipynb`).
